Godot Author's Own Collada Exporter
-----------------------------------

1) Copy the "io_scene_dae" directory  to wherever blender stores the 
   scripts/addons folder (You will see many other io_scene_blahblah like
   folders). Copy the entire dir, not just the contents, make it just like
   the others.
2) Go to Blender settings and enable the "Better Collada" plugin
3) Enjoy proper Collada export.
4) If it's broken, contact us.
